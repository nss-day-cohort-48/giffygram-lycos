<h3>Contributors</h3>

<p>This project was split by Team Lycos into three different areas of functionality. Roger Greenway developed our navigation bar, our gif posting display, and our registration screen. Lincoln Underwood designed our messaging form and functionality. Tom Clouse designed the footer filters, which enable the user to view messages from a specific year or user. Together, the team worked through various roadblocks, trials, tribulations, and other really complicated stuff to bring you this amazing site.</p>
